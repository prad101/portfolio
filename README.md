### Projects
**Agentic AI approach for alzheimer’s cognitive tests** (Research Project @ X-lab KSU) | RAG, Hugging Face (openBioLLM)
- Developing a knowledge graph-based cognitive Q&A tests for Alzheimer’s early disease detection leveraging large
language models (openBioLLM) and vector databases.

**AI-driven Molecular Simulation and binding mechanism for Drug Discovery** (Research Project @ X-lab KSU) | HPC, CUDA, Python, OpenMM
- Simulated virus–host protein interactions (SARS-like) to identify critical residues using High-Performance
computing (HPC) systems. Generated visualizations to extract key bonding interactions for lab validations.

**Conversational AI Support Assistant** (Part of OCI certification) | LangChain, OpenAI, Vector DB
- Developed a Langchain based chatbot using OpenAI to create a support assistant that answers technical queries of
a product by leveraging its documentation through RAG (FAISS).

**Simplify Research** (Academic Project) | OCR (pytesseract), regex, OpenAI
